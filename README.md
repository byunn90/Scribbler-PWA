# ‚úç Scribbler-PWA

## Description:

The text editor is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that works as a single-page application, allowing you to take notes or write code snippets with or without an internet connection. This application has been built using modern web technologies, such as IndexedDB, Webpack, Babel, Workbox, and WebpackPwaManifest plug-in. With this text editor, you can save your work, even when you're offline, and you can install it as a web app on your desktop or mobile device.

## Technologies Used:

- IndexedDB for creating an object store with GET and PUT methods.
- Webpack for bundling JavaScript files, generating HTML files, service workers, and a manifest file.
- Babel for converting next-gen JavaScript to ES5.
- Workbox for pre-caching static assets using a service worker.
- WebpackPwaManifest plug-in for generating the manifest file for the PWA.

## Usage:

The text editor allows you to create notes or write code snippets with an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface. You can save your work automatically inside the editor when the DOM window is unfocused. The application has been designed to resemble the mock-up functionality provided in the Challenge instructions. With this app, you can work online or offline and install it as a web app on your desktop or mobile device.

## Installation

To use the text editor, you can access the deployed application URL on Heroku or install it as a PWA by clicking on the "Install" button, which will download it as an icon on your desktop or mobile device.
